# Decomp

Decomp, short for decompose, is a Clojure tool for translating HTML into the
equivalent [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) AST. It was
developed for refactoring raw or static html easily into the Ring web
development stack.

The Hiccup formatting language allows the description of HTML syntax trees in
a Lisp-like prefix notation based on Clojure's Vector literal denoted ```clojure[]```. In
Hiccup one may say ```clojure [:a {:class "bar" :href "/"} "go home!"" ]```, which renders
to the equivalent html `<a href="/" class="bar"> go home! </a>`. As you can see
this is a fairly regular translation and the Hiccup tool makes it easy to go from
Clojure to HTML. Decomp decomposes the expanded html into the Huccup-equivalent
vector stack, completing the round trip.

## Get Decomp



## Example

```clojure
> (use 'me.arrdem.decomp.core)

;; process-string wraps the application of the lexer, parser and pprinter in one easy function
> (process-string "<foo a=\"b\"> this
                     <!-- ignored -->
                     <a href=\"/bar\">
                       goes home
                     </a>
                     as does
                     <a href=\"/\">
                       this!
                     </a>
                   </foo>")
[[:foo
    {:a "b"}
        "this"
    [:a {:href "/bar"} "goes home"]
    "as does"
    [:a {:href "/"} "this!"]]]
nil

;; Decomp supports arbitrary properties and tags...
> (process-string "<baz bung=\"1\" blarrrrrrrrgh=\"2\"> </baz>")
[[:baz {:blarrrrrrrrgh "2", :bung "1"}]]
nil
```

Decomp can also be used as a standalone tool able to translate files or standard input from html
to hiccup. The standalone jar can be invoked as ```shell $ java -jar decomp.jar foo.html``` just
as one would expect. Multiple file arguments are supported, and in the absence of file arguments
decomp will attempt to read & process HTML from standard input.

## Limitations

- Top-level comments for instance will break the parser
- Unbalanced open and close tokens will also kill the parser
- Parser does not do error checking to ensure that matched open and closes have equivalent values
- Javascript (due to semicolons and {}) will likely break the parser or at least behave strangely
- Inline CSS should work but is iffy
